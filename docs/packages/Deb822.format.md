The **Deb822 format** (also known as the RFC822-style format) is a structured, multiline configuration style used for managing software repositories in Debian-based systems. 

It replaces the traditional "one-line" style found in `/etc/apt/sources.list` and is the **default format starting with Ubuntu 24.04**. 

Key Features

- **Structured Key-Value Pairs**: Instead of a single long line, repository details are broken into clearly labeled fields like `Types:`, `URIs:`, and `Suites:`.
- **Stanzas**: Multiple repository definitions are separated by blank lines (paragraphs/stanzas) within a single file.
- **File Extension**: Files using this format must use the **`.sources`** extension and are typically stored in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/`.
- **Embedded Security**: You can embed an entire GPG public key directly into the `.sources` file using the `Signed-By:` field, eliminating the need for separate `.gpg` files. 

Comparison: Old vs. New

| Feature            | One-Line Style (`.list`)             | Deb822 Style (`.sources`)          |
| :----------------- | :----------------------------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| **Readability**    | Difficult with many options          | High; uses clear labels            |
| **Security**       | Global keyrings or `[signed-by=...]` | Explicit, per-repo embedded keys   |
| **Modularity**     | Hard to toggle specific components   | Easy `Enabled: yes/no` field       |
| **Ubuntu Default** | Pre-24.04 versions                   | **24.04 (Noble Numbat) and later** |

Example

A repository that used to look like this:
`deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/repo.gpg] https://repo.example.com/ubuntu noble main`

Now looks like this in a `.sources` file:

```
Types: deb
URIs: https://repo.example.com/ubuntu
Suites: noble
Components: main
Signed-By: /usr/share/keyrings/repo.gpg
```
